This file contains a Virtual Basic Physics and Maths Quiz that I created, it also contains a login system including admins (teachers) and a scoring system for students to compete in. Questions are created by the teacher and added to a database which are selected at random when completing the quiz.
The actual runnable quiz is contained within VBQuiz/PMQuizV3/PMQuizV1/bin/Debug/PMQuiz1.ex
